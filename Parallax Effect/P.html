                or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to
                achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

                India’s 7500 kilometre coastline provides several spots for surfboarding. The largest waves are
                typically seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season.

                Waters of India are already well-liked for hosting a range of adventure sports like rafting, kayaking,
                sailing, stream crossing, and plenty of others. One such upcoming sport is Surfing in India.

                The western coast is great for beginners to get acquainted with a surfboard, whereas eastern shores have
                stronger currents and harder wave breakpoints.

                Surfing in India is growing in quality, and there are some great spots along the country’s vast
                coastline where you can catch a wave and also learn to surf. The only issue is that the waves are not
                consistent and also the surf will flop sometimes. You just need to be at the correct place at the
                correct time!
